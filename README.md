# Text-to-Image Generation Project

## Overview
This project is a part of my internship at **CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS PVT. LTD** under the **Machine Learning** domain. The primary goal of the project is to develop a text-to-image generation application using free and open-source libraries. The application takes textual descriptions as input and generates corresponding visual representations or images, leveraging advanced generative models.

The project focuses on practical implementations of stable diffusion models to create high-quality images based on user-provided text. It is implemented in Python and executed on Google Colab to ensure accessibility and cost-effectiveness.
